1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,100
Thank you all for coming this is
about implementing transparency

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,120
in reproducibility in economics my name
is Lars ill humor I wear a lot of hats

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,970
I speak for none of them all of this is
my opinion except when it's expressed as

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,420
policy for
the American Economic Association I guess.

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,440
The background to where we're coming
from is the skull of this chorus

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,690
think of it as publications but
ultimately publications are only part

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,530
of a skull of a discourse that
is in person in exchanges

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,550
nowadays on Twitter back in
the 18th century by by letter.

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,882
The basic idea is that we exchange
ideas I'm going to be focusing

10
00:00:42,882 --> 00:00:47,752
here on publications and
publications early on contained more or

11
00:00:47,752 --> 00:00:52,372
less everything that was needed to support
the arguments that were being made

12
00:00:52,372 --> 00:00:56,852
when it relates to data contained tables
of the data and the math in general

13
00:00:56,852 --> 00:00:59,432
if you think about the early 20th
century it was relatively simple.

14
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:05,594
As data became electronic and
as math was transcribed to code

15
00:01:05,594 --> 00:01:10,264
some of the elements of these publications
started to disappear from the publication

16
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:15,644
record because in part they were
difficult to access difficult to store

17
00:01:15,644 --> 00:01:19,674
difficult to preserve if you think
of the sixties and seventies when

18
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:24,274
computer code was implemented on cards
in a definitely a transitory way

19
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:28,644
then it was very hard to sight it was
a very hard provided to somebody else.

20
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:34,697
This is my my favorite picture taken of

21
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:40,138
the very 1st issue of
the American Economic Review in 1011

22
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:44,438
the argument was about seasonal
variations in New York money market and

23
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:50,328
the data was provided as a big fold of
table publication format was adapted to

24
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:55,508
accommodate that this was larger than any
single page but it needed to be provided

25
00:01:55,508 --> 00:01:59,638
to any reader of this in a way that
allowed them to look at what was going on.

26
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:06,681
What we see today is often
a poor proxy for this and

27
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:12,291
if you look at how this looks on Jay's
store you have to scroll through 3

28
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:16,671
Scan p.d.f. pages that don't exactly
replicate what's going on here so

29
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:21,531
to some extent this hasn't gotten
much better there are of course

30
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:26,801
nowadays way many different ways of
highlighting these attributes and

31
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:31,481
publication but the key part is that data
tables like this in whatever format they

32
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:36,781
are in that particular machine readable
formats have been one of the issues that

33
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,401
are the absence of their
presentation has that for

34
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:44,772
mental to the idea of reproducibility So

35
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:50,632
my my motivation here is that modern
publications need to reacquire

36
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:55,922
similar transparency in completeness
as in the old simpler days and

37
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:58,392
that's a lot of what
the discussion has been about and.

38
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:03,502
We need to define 1st why that is
important what that actually is so

39
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:07,432
when I say replicability what
we actually mean by it or

40
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:12,432
we actually mean what I call the
replication continuum and there's various

41
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:17,392
definitions out there that have started to
standardize some of the terms around this

42
00:03:17,392 --> 00:03:20,912
because there have been many different
terms that have been given over time.

43
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:27,292
I will often use replicability it
just flows easier all the time within

44
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,802
reproducibility in particular
when you start conjugated.

45
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:34,193
But the definition in the this report and

46
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:39,573
others have sort of coalesced
around following me Priscilla t.

47
00:03:39,573 --> 00:03:44,543
is and often mentioned as
computational reproducibility is when

48
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:48,563
you have the same data the same code the
same methods the same context think of it

49
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:53,273
as an audit study what you see in front of
you actually produces what's in the paper.

50
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,410
It has been called other terms
in the in particular in economic

51
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,150
literature whether it be narrow
replication purification verification and

52
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,210
cetera and
I will often use the term verification

53
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,950
of computational reproducibility to
to describe what we are doing at the.

54
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:15,632
Replicability as is when you
take a step back from that so

55
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:19,352
replicability means we're going to start
implementing something with different

56
00:04:19,352 --> 00:04:25,104
codes different aspects of the code
different model different software

57
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:29,004
you might also do a new data
collection extend that they collect but

58
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:32,904
basically still on the same population
using fundamentally the same methods and

59
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:37,895
in this income things much of those
might occur within the same paper these

60
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:40,925
are the robustness tests that
your referees have asked for

61
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:45,705
that go into the appendix or that go into
further section on the robustness test so

62
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:49,925
they need not be something very
different in a different publication

63
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:54,747
generalizability on the other hand does

64
00:04:54,747 --> 00:04:59,637
go beyond any single paper
it's when folks started to.

65
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:05,277
Apply this to a very different
background when different data is being

66
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:09,247
used different methods are being used
different contexts or countries are being.

67
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:16,361
So that's sort of the overall framework
and there has been progress towards

68
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:19,221
improving what I hear mentioned
earlier the clarity and

69
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:21,931
availability of a common discourse about.

70
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:28,861
The subjects of articles so for one and
we'll be talking a lot about this

71
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:34,441
replication archives and data Villa built
the policies have been around now for

72
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:39,571
quite some time the 1st of these started
to emerge in the middle of the 1980 s.

73
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:44,751
they expand it substantially in the early
2000 the oldest replication archive is

74
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:49,661
the Journal of Applied
econometrics goes back to 1905 but

75
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:54,281
most of these journals have at some point
coalesced around a relatively common

76
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:59,551
standard of data available to policies but
part of that this course is also

77
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:04,961
shared open source software where there
are those are state packages or are itself

78
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:09,872
are all features that appeared
in the early 2000 and

79
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:13,522
they facilitate the discussion about
what's going on because now you actually

80
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:19,452
have a share platform where you can see
these these analysis being conducted.

81
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:27,794
Over the past 20 years better public using
shared data has emerged where that's open

82
00:06:28,794 --> 00:06:32,704
easily downloadable public
like I see kids are.

83
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:38,864
Or restricted access to research
they don't it works of this world

84
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:44,514
the federal one the Canadian one even
local ones in Quebec or in France or

85
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:51,146
in Germany are of are a product of the 2
thousands that have vastly expanded

86
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:56,606
joint common very open access
to data that underlies some

87
00:06:56,606 --> 00:07:00,426
confidentiality restrictions but yet it
is accessible to hundreds of researchers.

88
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:07,791
And better ways of accessing pretty
Prince is also a reaction to the absence

89
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:12,351
of a larger discussion
the idea that you might share

90
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:17,281
publications prior to their appear of you
and prior to their publication the more

91
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:22,581
formal that you're with off call the great
literature is a product of the early 2000

92
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:27,361
were computers in economics go back to
the seventy's but both in economics and

93
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:32,131
in physics mathematics archive these
expanded greatly in the early 2000

94
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:37,632
so it doesn't mean that we have
no reproducibility issues well

95
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:41,212
the recent discussion about
replicability crisis clearly says no.

96
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:49,684
On this continuum of just checking for
reproducibility

97
00:07:49,684 --> 00:07:55,584
the simply testing materials as provided
by authors the graph here shows

98
00:07:55,584 --> 00:08:00,684
statistics just a heuristic I don't want
to go into many of the details about

99
00:08:00,684 --> 00:08:04,504
various tests that have been done over the
years and they tend to gravitate around.

100
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:10,606
Low twenty's 30 percent with colored
dots at the end are from an experiment

101
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:15,106
that we ran a couple years ago of going
through all the replication archives of

102
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:19,776
one Journal of the American Economic
Association and there is a definitional

103
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:25,336
issue which reads to their bean multiple
thoughts there as to what is actually

104
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:30,286
perfect reproducibility if you classify
something as reproducible if it is

105
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:37,147
partially reproducible you use the access
to the data as a criterion for

106
00:08:37,147 --> 00:08:41,027
selecting what you even attempt to do and
so these very along these lines.

107
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:46,707
The relatively high percentage that's
shown there is that when they die is

108
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:52,167
available and we succeed in reproducing
at least half of the tables and

109
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:57,867
figures in the paper we classified it as
reproducible and that is about 85 percent.

110
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,090
The breakdown here is that there is a
large fraction within economics that uses

111
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:10,320
restricted access data and so is 85
percent of when the data is available

112
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,860
half full or half empty glasses is
a matter of discussion many in the open

113
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,200
access community see that as a tremendous
all there is currently discussions under

114
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,300
e.p.a. to rules to consider whether
data that cannot be openly shared

115
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,060
is actually appropriately used for
analysis and or policy

116
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:37,361
failure to cure rate should have been
obsoleted by the data availability

117
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:40,801
policies by authors providing
the materials to the journals but

118
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:45,951
is still something that is of concern
especially when the cannot be shared

119
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:51,284
in a variety of ways percent
Asian practices make tracking

120
00:09:51,284 --> 00:09:56,855
down which data was actually used when
it is not provided quite difficult time

121
00:09:56,855 --> 00:10:01,395
so these are actual quotes from papers and
there is the full

122
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:06,415
extent of how the data was actually
sourced and that may not always be enough.

123
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:14,085
But archives or data providers are also
part of the problem because many

124
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:19,025
don't provide permanent locations and
there are a few high profile over and

125
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:23,115
stations participating in this call
as they are on every one of these

126
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:27,225
presentations that I've given and
the they are challenging at times for

127
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:31,585
researchers to identify where they got
the data from because the data provider

128
00:10:31,585 --> 00:10:36,465
themselves do not necessarily provide very
clear dissin structures on where the data

129
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:40,457
might be 5 or 10 years from now so
what can we do

130
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:47,768
the 1st realization was in many of
the social sciences at least that you need

131
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:52,601
stronger enforcement of such data and
actually code availability policy.

132
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:57,701
So it's not sufficient to simply post
such a policy to get some sort of package

133
00:10:57,701 --> 00:11:03,701
thrown on to your website and be done as
it turns out that doesn't work reliably

134
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:07,591
and so starting particular with the
American Journal of Political Science but

135
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:12,261
then expanding including to the n.e.a.
but also other econ journals greater and

136
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:17,151
Foresman of these policies has been
a recent innovation if you want

137
00:11:18,783 --> 00:11:24,623
so verifying the reproducibility is one
key to improving the overall weepers built

138
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:30,313
to do so prior to publication introduces
additional complexity that I'll talk about

139
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:36,265
you know that but current they develop
military policies were also broken so

140
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:41,235
for one if the data act was not open
access so say it was a restricted access

141
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:46,125
data set the basic approach
was to grant an exemption but

142
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:49,915
exemption then meant that you also no
longer provided systematic information as

143
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:54,365
to where you got the data from and that's
very important but on the other hand

144
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:58,505
should you even provide the data for
such deposit if the data are already

145
00:11:58,505 --> 00:12:03,315
somewhere else so you destroyed by
requesting that the data be deposited you

146
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:07,295
often destroyed some of the provenance
information that came with it and

147
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,765
if they don't are at what we would
consider to be very robust archive should

148
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:16,555
you even ask to have the positive
you should definitely a scribe

149
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:21,105
where they are and so some of the movement
in the last couple of years has been about

150
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:25,525
requiring greater transparency of the
provenance of data and code and figuring

151
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:29,475
out ways to get authors to provide that
information to displayed in journals.

152
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,510
You might have why were
journals actually asking for

153
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,340
these supplemental zip files and
all these things will show you want for

154
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,760
one that obsolescence of various web
pages leads to an availability of

155
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,820
these things over time journals
can ensure a legitimate and

156
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,490
persistence of these archives by
taking custody of these objects and

157
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,240
putting them on to their websites
you can ensure access our website so

158
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,240
we know that you can access that
something's not going to go away or

159
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,950
that won't be any complicated things
accessing with the Cabinet of course that

160
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:08,082
there might be pay walls and they can
ensure that the availability is there but

161
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:12,752
that's precisely what trusted repositories
have as a business purpose call the data

162
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:17,692
archives call them trusted repositories
their goal is to ensure such longevity

163
00:13:17,692 --> 00:13:22,642
persistence access and build built and
with the advent of new

164
00:13:22,642 --> 00:13:27,672
self deposit repositories this has become
easier over time now itself the positive

165
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:31,082
positive words are not a replacement for
properly curated data at professional

166
00:13:31,082 --> 00:13:35,362
repositories there's a difference between
dropping something into a bucket and

167
00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:40,012
being sure that it is going to stay
around for the next 203050 years and

168
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:44,022
actually creating data documentation and
other things that relate to that but

169
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:48,682
this is a huge advance there
are a number of sites out there data

170
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:53,792
Versteeg share open i.c.p. is ours in
OTOH most of them are free some of them

171
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:58,602
are with a commercial base some of them
are nonprofit so there's a huge diversity

172
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:03,972
that allows researchers at various
stages in their research lifecycle

173
00:14:03,972 --> 00:14:08,062
to deposit data and ensure at least
the permanence and the accessibility of.

174
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:13,890
But what do we do about the restricted
access to the well in fact

175
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,160
many of the same networks have
grown into the equivalent

176
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,100
of a data repast atory of
it they don't archive.

177
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,370
There are a number of people from the fs
r.t.c. on this call and clearly that not

178
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:31,680
work has acquired attributes that
are more a big bully associated with at

179
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,140
with open archives elsewhere the data is
preserved the data is made available and

180
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,910
there is a process for accessing it
just isn't a simple ballot and so

181
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:46,100
they have many of the same features
of these of trusted positiveness So

182
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,970
the idea is to use trust
repositories wherever possible but

183
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:54,030
also going back to the previous light to
describe the provenance from the stress

184
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,340
preposterous of the analysis
results all the way into the paper

185
00:14:58,842 --> 00:15:04,103
now there are problems with that for one I
mentioned earlier the curation problem and

186
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,633
cetacean problem when we
started to expand to other

187
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:12,626
allowable repositories not all are created
equal to start with the most obvious thing

188
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:17,316
that I get to see a lot of times get
up Dropbox and the same are not data or

189
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:22,086
code repositories at all at any point
in time somebody can delete their stuff

190
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:26,686
from Dropbox there's no permanence
that is insured in any way and

191
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:29,676
those are commercial companies
that might go out of business and

192
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:34,196
who knows what they have in terms of
a permanence or a transition policy but

193
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:38,746
it also applies to various institutions
whether you might be thinking of

194
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:43,756
an institutional University repository
in a zone in a conflict zone

195
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:47,796
whether you're talking about at Cornell

196
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:52,326
where I I think it might be reliable but
is it actually for the next 20 years or

197
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:56,616
a big institutions like our Are the
National Archives a reliable Republican

198
00:15:56,616 --> 00:16:00,876
they rely on funding that is not
necessarily assured for 50 years.

199
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,030
Restricted access repositories or similar
if I can take custody of the data as they

200
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,370
don't have to stay someplace How long will
it stay there and what are they doing to

201
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,130
preserve it if I'm using data from
some bank will they preserve it so

202
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,550
that even if somebody else is allowed to
access it 3 years 10 years from now will

203
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,310
there still be data how about school
districts how about research institutes

204
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,340
affiliated with private institutions
about the sense of fear.

205
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:35,600
So while many of these may actually be
good repugnant Tories the challenge for

206
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,661
for people using them is to figure out
are they actually were positive so

207
00:16:41,872 --> 00:16:45,452
there is a need to describe them
describe them in various ways

208
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:50,202
infrastructure to support that kind
of description is evolving and

209
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:56,365
one of the key things is to say now
that this is definitely not something

210
00:16:56,365 --> 00:17:01,245
that originated in economics
the idea of fair meditate and

211
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:08,935
fair data is all about figuring out how to
preserve these data in an open a fashion

212
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:13,735
and it should be pointed out the fair data
principles apply primarily to manage it so

213
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:17,125
it's the meditator that has to be
open they don't need not be but

214
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:23,015
it needs to be find of all accessible
interoperable and reuse assessing that for

215
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:25,745
various repositories around
the world is a challenge.

216
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:31,734
They say cation principles help with that
but said they decide to Asians themselves

217
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:36,764
or not enough principles have
enough information in them to be

218
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:42,614
useful but they decide to actions as
we see them in journals actually do not

219
00:17:42,614 --> 00:17:47,434
because they tell you where there might
be if they are sufficiently precise but

220
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:50,274
they don't really tell you who
can access for how long and

221
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:54,204
under what conditions principle These are
covered by this efficient principles but

222
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:56,974
they're not covered by the style
guides that we tend to use for

223
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:59,834
these kind of things if
even we do get a situation.

224
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,380
So emerging to support of better
transparency of that have been data

225
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,160
they'll ability statements I'll
get back to what that implies at

226
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,130
the American Economic Association you know
that so they develop built the state and

227
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:20,190
expand on data citations the do not
replace data citation they allow

228
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,590
authors to have clarify where the data is
including various ways of accessing that

229
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,820
they should highlight reasons how
the data can be made available or

230
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,340
not which increases transparency they
shouldn't principle say something

231
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,430
about how long the data would be
available and about usage rights.

232
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:43,741
We tend to think for instance that
government data is in the public domain

233
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:46,271
but that's not always true
elsewhere in the world and

234
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:49,611
that may not be obvious to other readers
who are not familiar with what the u.s.

235
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:54,231
government rules on these things are and
that is that extends to

236
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:58,041
all sorts of things just because you can
download it from the internet does not

237
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,881
actually mean that you have the rights
to give it to somebody else and so

238
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:06,223
the usage rights are very
important to convey So

239
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:11,493
all of that leads to the goal and the need
to improve the provenance documentation

240
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:16,154
of the data assets that go
into our publication so

241
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:22,495
why should we actually care about for
one and this is

242
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:27,225
statement of desirability not necessarily
the most convincing argument for

243
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:32,575
people who think that we are credible the
credibility is one of the key facets here

244
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:38,966
think of statements about the long
run impacts of an epidemic and

245
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:42,276
I'm not talking about the most recent
one I'm talking about the color

246
00:19:42,276 --> 00:19:45,856
if you want to believe
statements about the effect

247
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:50,366
of that Demick on long term outcomes
you're going to see graphics

248
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:53,286
that sort of describe this analysis
that look at these kind of things

249
00:19:53,286 --> 00:19:57,296
you want to know where these come from and
that ultimately means

250
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,956
that you need to look at where
the data underlying it comes from.

251
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,910
And those might be quite old but

252
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,302
you still need to find some of it and
you need to be sure that those

253
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:13,992
are the relevant ones that's what
academic discussions actually imply So

254
00:20:13,992 --> 00:20:21,092
once you have that idea there you
can now think of where is the data

255
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:27,093
store that was used for this analysis and
you can go in and download that data.

256
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:29,773
Or.

257
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:36,934
You can download that data and
you can download the code for that.

258
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,289
And you can look at the code and you can
now assess as a scientist whether or

259
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:51,959
not this analysis makes sense you
can rerun it you can apply other

260
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:56,969
things you can replicate it and
you can possibly expand or generalize it.

261
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:05,070
And that's what better a positive is
associated with journals are doing so

262
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,940
the credibility of the claims in the paper
a lives on the transparency of every piece

263
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,660
of the aspect there all the way
back to the source data

264
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,510
the methods to transform that and
then finally you know.

265
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:20,662
That credibility is key to understanding

266
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:25,392
the statistics that we see around us or
this we see in the scientific literature.

267
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:29,336
Ok so

268
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:32,336
let me then switch to what we're doing
at the American Economic Association.

269
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:39,038
The American economic says Asia has
Eternals and the policies that are going

270
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:44,228
to describe apply this point to all
8 of them to varying degrees as

271
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:49,340
they came into the process
that we developed so

272
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:56,442
in a nutshell we have aspired to do 3
other things 1st to preemptively improve

273
00:21:56,442 --> 00:22:01,695
code archives 2nd to
create better archives and

274
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:06,285
in particular to ensure that they have
greater transparency and coming Corporate

275
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:11,568
it into the scientific architecture and
overall better provenance truck.

276
00:22:12,591 --> 00:22:16,921
Over time that means to leave code aware
of where it is when that is appropriate

277
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:21,983
and to leave data where it is when that
is appropriate that is a challenge and

278
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:26,316
I'll get to some of those aspects so
the policy has been around for

279
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:31,416
a while but what we did is we changed
some of the policy to reemphasize

280
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,686
some of these key aspects
to it clearly and

281
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:39,706
precisely documented wasn't always the
case before we start enforcing this and so

282
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:44,368
we will look at that readily available
our aspects both for data and for

283
00:22:44,368 --> 00:22:51,740
code that can be tested and we test that
and it used to be that the emphasis was

284
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,650
to provide prior to publication that turns
out sometimes to be a challenge to get

285
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:02,072
authors once a papers accepted to provide
the materials on time the policy asked for

286
00:23:02,072 --> 00:23:07,885
details sufficient to permit replication
that's an aspirational goal and

287
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:12,587
we set out to modify the policies that we
are actually going to start testing that

288
00:23:12,587 --> 00:23:15,777
and we used to post things on
the a website I just showed an example of

289
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:20,359
a recent publication where we have
moved to a new infrastructure so

290
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:26,159
considering these things last year in
July we expanded on this policy and

291
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,809
clarified a few things 1st of all point is
that the access to the data in the code

292
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:35,819
is clearly and precisely document and
we emphasize the fact that it has to be

293
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:40,779
non-exclusive to the office non-exclusive
means there needs to be a reasonable way

294
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:47,500
in which others can access the same code
and the same data we moved to requiring

295
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,511
these materials prior to acceptance and
believe me that into his a very

296
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:57,121
high degree of compliance because unless
those materials are provided the paper

297
00:23:57,121 --> 00:24:00,243
doesn't actually get accepted and

298
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:03,093
we actually test some of
the information about access to data.

299
00:24:04,163 --> 00:24:06,821
As well as whether it's sufficient.

300
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:11,911
And we moved on to posting on the website
to being archived in a repository where we

301
00:24:11,911 --> 00:24:16,771
collaborated with the openness p s r
to have a journal specific repository

302
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:19,981
you know itself that's not
an innovation others have done that

303
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:24,771
way before the American Economic
Association but it's important for

304
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:27,891
part of the creation of it archives so

305
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:32,571
let me describe a bit what we actually
do for these 3 different components

306
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:39,082
preemptively improving code archives means
we actually conduct reproducibility we run

307
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:44,002
code as provided by the authors we use the
data as provided by the authors we will

308
00:24:44,002 --> 00:24:48,982
download data as instructed by the authors
and when I say by the authors it is

309
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:53,762
in writing in the read me that everybody
else can see after it's published so

310
00:24:53,762 --> 00:24:56,902
no private correspondence between us and
the authors in general other than to

311
00:24:56,902 --> 00:25:02,242
clarify whether you know we are your
guinea pig essentially as authors

312
00:25:02,242 --> 00:25:06,312
because afterwards anybody else should be
able to do exactly what we did except we

313
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:11,923
do it prior to publication now 40 percent
of They'd are not accessible What can we

314
00:25:11,923 --> 00:25:16,073
do there we work with groups that actually
can conduct reproducibility checks for

315
00:25:16,073 --> 00:25:20,213
us when we cannot and
that doesn't need to be very complicated.

316
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:27,423
We have sometimes obtained data from
groups where the data is proprietary but

317
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:31,693
not necessarily confidential and so
we have been able to run reproducibility

318
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:36,803
checks there we have work with groups
who have access to say the universe

319
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:41,423
of tax files in the United States that
we didn't have access to ourselves and

320
00:25:41,423 --> 00:25:46,583
we asked them to run reproducibility check
on their colleagues but not co-authors So

321
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:51,163
we have worked successfully with a lot
of groups the the complexity of data

322
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:55,303
access sometimes means that we
are going to ask others to run that for

323
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,063
us we have been quite successful with.

324
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,520
What we do is that for
every paper we verify

325
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,730
these various aspects 1st of all
provenance documentation we look for

326
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:13,331
data fixations I'll show you what those
might look like it is a key aspect it has

327
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:18,231
been in principle and the a is guidelines
for a decade but very poorly enforced so

328
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:22,491
we enforce that now we look at the quality
of the review can we actually understand

329
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:25,571
what's being said in the week is
that just a one line to run this

330
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:28,991
thing with no information about where
to get the data or what to do or

331
00:26:28,991 --> 00:26:34,041
is it a very explicit read and we've seen
everything from the 2 liners to the 50

332
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:38,992
pages we look at the quality of the code
and I'm not saying that we are checking

333
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:43,652
that the code is right that is of
a very different of magnitude.

334
00:26:44,882 --> 00:26:49,542
We are checking to see is it clear
from the code where table one is being

335
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:53,182
generated were analysis data
step one is being created and

336
00:26:53,182 --> 00:26:55,302
why certain aspects are being.

337
00:26:56,944 --> 00:27:01,267
It is is this intelligibly documented and

338
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:04,897
then if we have the data on the code and
enough instructions in reach me

339
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:08,117
we attempt to follow those instructions
to reproduce the analysis and.

340
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:13,148
Finally we look at the Met in the
repository that I'll show you in a moment.

341
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,780
I should emphasize we only
do a reproducibility check

342
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,091
we do not do replication or generalization
that's for the literature to do but

343
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:28,771
we ensure that that 1st step that at least
this run of the and these results and this

344
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:33,341
paper have some unbearable basis to them
and that the next persons can start from

345
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:38,601
that basis to then start modifying the
various other aspects on the replication.

346
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,550
All the guidance we provide the remains
that we expect to have which should been

347
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:49,320
read me the replication template
that we use are posted publicly so

348
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,000
anybody who thinks of
submitting an article and

349
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,520
Copely getting it accepted at the American
economic associations journals

350
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,200
can look at our various websites and
find the guidelines for it so

351
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,180
there's no no surprises who is
doing this well the checkers

352
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:09,500
are not seasoned economists with tenure
they're undergraduates not necessarily

353
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,750
all from economics but they can read or
read me they can follow English language

354
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,110
instructions they know how to run state
they know the run Matlab Sometimes they

355
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,290
know how to run all sorts of
a complicated Python or Giulia things.

356
00:28:23,413 --> 00:28:28,083
Over the past year we've trained about 50
undergraduates to do this work with us

357
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:31,123
Mary with well just my graduate assistant
who is also on this call right now and

358
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:37,004
there's a few others who have helped me
in the past we trained undergraduates

359
00:28:37,004 --> 00:28:42,084
do this and they do a very good job of
it so if we can train undergraduates to

360
00:28:42,084 --> 00:28:46,974
verify the computation weepers ability it
should be relatively straightforward for

361
00:28:46,974 --> 00:28:52,104
ph d. economists and tenured faculty and
longtime apply to Congress to do the same

362
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:58,115
thing goal is here to improve
the Expos reproducibility

363
00:28:58,115 --> 00:29:03,515
goal is that when something is posted
with our articles on their website that

364
00:29:03,515 --> 00:29:08,215
we can measure it with a very high
probability that it actually reproduces

365
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:12,956
after that there are still possibilities
that we missed something or

366
00:29:12,956 --> 00:29:17,786
that it ran for us but the documentation
wasn't sufficient to replicate it 5 or

367
00:29:17,786 --> 00:29:19,806
10 years from now we
don't know that we do or.

368
00:29:24,938 --> 00:29:29,108
That and I mention that all this
information is publicly on the web there

369
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:33,808
are in the slides that at the end links to
these various websites where these are.

370
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:40,771
Replication template is also out there
it is a simple report that the students

371
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:43,641
write with lots of instructions
on what to do step by step.

372
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:48,151
And it's not the same thing as read me
because we're checking that everything has

373
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:49,531
but it very much aligns with.

374
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:58,722
What have we done these are statistics
from the end of November so

375
00:29:58,722 --> 00:30:03,082
we are now April 1st of this that's
changed a lot but in the 1st 4 and

376
00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:09,412
a half months as we were ramping up
we did 216 assessments 438 papers

377
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:15,633
Ok as of yesterday we have
approximately 600 assessments

378
00:30:16,904 --> 00:30:22,284
and assessments are not the same
thing as manuscripts many

379
00:30:22,284 --> 00:30:26,784
scripts tend to go through multiple cycles
we have yet to see a manuscript that it's

380
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:30,894
accepted on 1st pass but sometimes
turnaround can be quite quick and

381
00:30:32,337 --> 00:30:36,047
this is an order of magnitude larger
than what most other journals are doing.

382
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:41,909
And that is an issue that we can talk
about in the discussion later on Ok.

383
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:48,249
We're still spending a lot of time doing
this it takes longer than we would like to

384
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:52,349
sometimes that's because
the computation is actually take long

385
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:56,379
sometimes it's simply because
we have received too many for

386
00:30:56,379 --> 00:31:01,090
the kind of staff that we
have at present we have

387
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:05,330
18 undergraduates working on it we're
in the process of training another 15.

388
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,920
And.

389
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:13,760
There is enough rotation with these
students that these folks stay with me for

390
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,520
a while but also come summer
some of these will be going off

391
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,612
to work with various research
institutions for internships etc So

392
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:26,312
we are constantly training
new undergraduates to be or

393
00:31:26,312 --> 00:31:32,293
are verified and
we work with various other agencies

394
00:31:32,293 --> 00:31:36,273
2 of these have helped me in
the past the 3rd one has not yet so

395
00:31:36,273 --> 00:31:43,671
that we outsource some of
the verifications as well Ok.

396
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:48,131
So what I mean with better archives so
once we've checked this the code and

397
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:53,171
the data should be in an archive Well
that's where our data and code repository

398
00:31:53,171 --> 00:31:58,961
comes where in the past this was simply is
a file sitting on the web page now we have

399
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:04,051
Rich method they do that can be
added to the deposits we have a full

400
00:32:04,051 --> 00:32:09,701
viewable listing of all the data of all
the files that are within this the posit

401
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:13,871
you can download them individually you
can download the entire deposit and

402
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:19,932
you get citations of these as well of
course it's necessary to link it back so

403
00:32:19,932 --> 00:32:25,682
we have both linkages back to the article
and from the article to this using

404
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:30,902
the existing infrastructure of DUIs and
the linkages that are behind.

405
00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:38,414
There is also arcane meditative stuff
within these pages whether that's Dublin

406
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:43,494
core or whether that's some Jaison stuff
that is also important for the fine

407
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:47,184
ability of these because now you can
actually find that through Google Scholar

408
00:32:47,184 --> 00:32:51,684
or Google dataset search or some other
search engine that might be in use now or

409
00:32:51,684 --> 00:32:56,204
in the future so
this integrates the deposits into a very

410
00:32:56,204 --> 00:33:01,514
powerful way of accessing both the data
in through the data back to the article

411
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:08,464
some statistics from what we've
done about 72 percent of all

412
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:12,564
data that all articles that
we use use Stay don't.

413
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:18,416
Need 2 percent use Matlab and
there's a sprinkling of open source so

414
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:23,126
the bulk of what we see comes
from state and that is that.

415
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:29,946
Is that comparable to other sciences
No it's not there are very different

416
00:33:29,946 --> 00:33:33,636
software usages across the disciplines and
this is one testament of it but

417
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:37,876
it may say life easier because we can
focus on getting our undergrads trained

418
00:33:37,876 --> 00:33:42,058
on these 2 items are there differences
in the reproducibility of that.

419
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,990
The analysis for that is to follow.

420
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:52,011
Ok And finally better provenance tracking
and this goes back to that in a situation

421
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:57,032
is and often very intense working
with the authors to improve so

422
00:33:57,032 --> 00:34:00,512
there's a teaching principle say
that you actually want to put

423
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:04,342
the proper credits and attribute
into the provider of the data and

424
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:08,972
this is one of our sample citations
that has been on the A's website for

425
00:34:08,972 --> 00:34:15,033
the past decade and yet most of the time
these are absent from from the manuscripts

426
00:34:16,516 --> 00:34:21,428
but we want this to be clearly and
precisely document so we go

427
00:34:21,428 --> 00:34:26,448
through the manuscript the article itself
the online appendix that read me and

428
00:34:26,448 --> 00:34:31,728
verify is is the is
the particular data object said

429
00:34:31,728 --> 00:34:35,458
is there additional information
on access do you as the u.r.l.

430
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:40,378
actually lead to exact data if you want
to download the c.p.s. from the u.s.

431
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:45,098
Census Bureau website you can't
just quote w w that sense that

432
00:34:45,098 --> 00:34:50,138
is insufficient to actually get to
the data without additional research

433
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,009
if there is an application procedure
do we have enough information to find

434
00:34:55,009 --> 00:35:00,322
the application procedure are the other
access procedures described

435
00:35:00,322 --> 00:35:03,782
if they are they complicated
are they do they last long is

436
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:07,382
there money involved is there time
involved is there Ira be involved so

437
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:09,682
all these things are important for
research or

438
00:35:09,682 --> 00:35:14,952
to assess how complicated might it be
to actually reproduce this particular.

439
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,480
And finally I mentioned this
earlier is a license for

440
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,720
data use information should the author
provide the data so we have had

441
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,180
quite a few cases where the author says
I can't provide you with the data and

442
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,700
we check the information about the usage
rights that the author acquired and

443
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:37,030
the answer might actually be yes and then
unless we find a reasonable repository for

444
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,420
the data the author actually has to
provide the converse Lee we often check

445
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,520
whether the author is allowed to
provide that and again we have checked

446
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,880
some data use agreements and have told
the authors know if you actually cannot

447
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,670
provide this data thank you for providing
it to us for application but you don't

448
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:57,550
have to remove it from the archive these
are important aspects as we go through

449
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:02,181
the overall provenance documentation and
author struggle with this.

450
00:36:03,923 --> 00:36:06,383
We have saved authors from

451
00:36:06,383 --> 00:36:12,073
infringing on their data use agreements by
2nd guessing their ability to provide us

452
00:36:12,073 --> 00:36:16,033
with an author says I think I've
obviously getting the data enough.

453
00:36:18,004 --> 00:36:22,304
We will ask the question whether or not
their data provider actually thinks that

454
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:28,145
she's created or anonymised or
otherwise post-process the data but they

455
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:33,738
don't publish a struggle with it as well
they make it very hard to find exactly or

456
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:37,468
else going to call up the o.e.c.d. here
because they know that the o.e.c.d. is

457
00:36:37,468 --> 00:36:41,718
actually working on changing this website
to something that actually allows the user

458
00:36:41,718 --> 00:36:46,668
to do that as you navigate the o.e.c.d.
statistics the euro doesn't change when it

459
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:51,728
does change it doesn't change again when
you sort of dig down into their table so

460
00:36:51,728 --> 00:36:55,518
that is quite hard to actually cite
the precise table that you want

461
00:36:55,518 --> 00:36:59,288
somebody to you have to literally
describe how you navigate this issue.

462
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,580
Can you download the data or not lots of
academic data publishers research groups

463
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:10,240
etc Put it out there and as it turns
out there's a copyright on it and

464
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,980
unless you ask for permission that
copyright says you cannot redistribute

465
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,060
the data unless you invoke some sort
of fair use and good luck with that but

466
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,870
these folks are also
open to discussions so

467
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:26,640
when we see something like that and
we see it for the 2nd time we go and

468
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,500
ask folks whether or not that is
actually their intent and for for

469
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:35,080
this particular site would you see is
actually an archive because after we asked

470
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,240
they changed their license very clearly to
Creative Commons which explicitly allows

471
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,131
you to redistribute the data and
other say they're not going to do that

472
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:48,391
that they want authors to go back to their
original website to download the data

473
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:55,891
many websites now provide
a suggested academic style citation.

474
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:01,711
The St Louis Fed does an excellent job
with that citing both the original

475
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:06,131
provider of the data as well
as where you got the data so

476
00:38:06,131 --> 00:38:11,121
those 2 elements are that you are all
that they provide within that city is 100

477
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:16,473
percent sufficient to recover
the data at that point in time and

478
00:38:16,473 --> 00:38:20,953
finally restricted access data
is also perfectly feasibly

479
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:25,653
documented in such a way that German
r.t.c. has done an excellent job of

480
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:30,503
assigning DUIs to each one of their
confidential restricted access dataset and

481
00:38:30,503 --> 00:38:36,933
all versions there are of listing them on
a website and that DUI leads to a page for

482
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:41,043
each of these various versions
that describes among other things

483
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:47,135
the requirements for data access so
those are important aspects.

484
00:38:49,176 --> 00:38:53,996
And the question here and open in
the floor with some suggestions 1st for

485
00:38:53,996 --> 00:39:00,537
authors the key to creating
reproducible code and

486
00:39:00,537 --> 00:39:06,420
data archives is to follow some robust
coding lines automate as much as possible.

487
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,870
If we have seen code archives
that had manual changes to.

488
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:17,510
2 various programs $37.00 times in
order to generate various aspects

489
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:23,201
of the robustness checks that is can
be automated we have seen authors write

490
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:27,321
Fortran programs and Rican pile every
time that they changed the premise or

491
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:32,031
somewhere on line 750 of the code
use methods to circle for

492
00:39:32,031 --> 00:39:34,411
cycle through programs think of.

493
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:38,601
Only slightly more sophisticated
programming tools that each and

494
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:42,791
every one of these programming languages
has and at the end when you're done with

495
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:46,901
your manuscript before you submit
it run all that analysis code again

496
00:39:48,264 --> 00:39:52,934
there are cabinets to suppose
your analysis runs for 3 months

497
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:57,894
that is probably not doable so
keep meticulous logs and

498
00:39:57,894 --> 00:40:02,154
sure that all the aspects are done in a
way that you you can still figure out how

499
00:40:02,154 --> 00:40:06,805
you ran the 1st part of this by the time
that you get to the last we recently had

500
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:12,005
a very long discussions with authors
who are using public use data but

501
00:40:12,005 --> 00:40:16,845
were using a model that required half a
1000000 compute cycles on a supercomputer

502
00:40:16,845 --> 00:40:21,585
cluster we were not going to rerun that
but we were discussing with them how much

503
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,985
of the intermediate data they could
provide us and other authors in order for

504
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:29,685
at least parts of the analysis
to be efficiently

505
00:40:29,685 --> 00:40:34,487
reproduced as part of the archive we're
still looking for the magic bullet for

506
00:40:34,487 --> 00:40:38,999
that we prefer master scripts and

507
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:44,259
authors should prefer master scripts I
already mentioned no manual manipulation

508
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:46,859
also no manual copying of
results if you're writing

509
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:50,769
out results into one area and you for
the next that reference it in place

510
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:55,589
right out tables and figures don't
hand copy from various log files

511
00:40:55,589 --> 00:41:00,559
compute all numbers in a package if
you've got instructions about this is

512
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:05,250
the city you can computed like this that's
also something you can stick into code and

513
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,400
then have the code say this
is what goes on page 5.

514
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,710
Some of the more subtle things are that
you might have been working on this paper

515
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,870
for 5 years and
you have all the packages necessary but

516
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:20,961
the next person out won't what
are the versions of those packages so

517
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:25,271
no manual install of packages to create
scripts to create all the prerequisites to

518
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:30,912
install necessary packages we provide
templates for that for state for our.

519
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:36,162
For Python it's embedded within the way
that Python environments can be set up

520
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:41,902
every single language has some way
of doing and not unimportantly when

521
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:45,612
you use those packages checked if their
package author who's done an enormous

522
00:41:45,612 --> 00:41:50,302
amount of work that you're benefiting from
actually requires some citation again we

523
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:54,822
check that occasionally and as it turns
out many of your favorites either packages

524
00:41:54,822 --> 00:41:58,932
actually want to be cited for the original
paper that they were created in or

525
00:41:58,932 --> 00:42:03,963
wherever they are so do that because
that's how those authors get credit

526
00:42:03,963 --> 00:42:09,407
you're not paying them you're giving them
credit in clear instructions we don't

527
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:15,387
need replicators do not need a long prose
description of the process of getting

528
00:42:15,387 --> 00:42:20,337
a linear checklist is really all that
that's needed if that is not already done

529
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:25,747
by the master script that doesn't always
work but so have a clear instructions

530
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:32,388
provide the data cetaceans
they cetaceans are not hard.

531
00:42:33,588 --> 00:42:37,668
Provided availability statements in the
review or the appendix What does it take

532
00:42:37,668 --> 00:42:41,568
to actually get the data beyond simply
knowing where the data comes from and

533
00:42:41,568 --> 00:42:46,878
there are very many tricky data Satish How
do you site at the us at that you extract

534
00:42:46,878 --> 00:42:51,028
it from the banks credit card information
they base out of a particular date.

535
00:42:52,558 --> 00:42:57,000
These are sight of all just as much as
other things were said a bill in the past

536
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,900
and we have a website where many
of these examples are given and

537
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,700
examples and how you can then cite.

538
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:09,351
We are currently discussing among

539
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:14,231
econ generals about incorporating
they develop build the statements and

540
00:43:14,231 --> 00:43:19,031
incorporating a lot of the requested
information into a standardized meet

541
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:23,822
that then could be used by authors
an example of that is on the website

542
00:43:25,263 --> 00:43:29,973
for institutions the key thing is that
many of these things many of these

543
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:34,913
new features are just that they
are new to most researchers and

544
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:39,993
so training in these novel methods
within various centers institutions etc

545
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:43,503
are important for current researchers for
future researchers So

546
00:43:43,503 --> 00:43:47,933
universities have a role of integrating
this into curricula but it might just as

547
00:43:47,933 --> 00:43:53,543
well be that this is the summer intern who
can that you get people to go through.

548
00:43:55,285 --> 00:44:00,236
Institutions need to provide better tools
to streamline the process do you ice for

549
00:44:00,236 --> 00:44:01,056
research data.

550
00:44:02,496 --> 00:44:07,286
The positive mechanisms that
are integrated into how faculty work on

551
00:44:07,286 --> 00:44:11,796
campuses how we search as work within
their institutions facilitating citation

552
00:44:11,796 --> 00:44:18,566
by putting the obvious 87 ways
into the publication materials and

553
00:44:18,566 --> 00:44:23,828
the websites that provide access to
the data and just generally awareness.

554
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:31,429
Training for replicators is not hard there
are a lot of instances out there Katie and

555
00:44:31,429 --> 00:44:32,399
I are working on.

556
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:39,849
A training module at at bits I am
regularly training my own replicators for

557
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:44,289
the particular job project here has been
around and has some good guidance there as

558
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:49,059
well this is mainly
focused on on students but

559
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:54,320
all these materials can be repurposed for
staff training as well and

560
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,560
there may be scope to have formal
internal verification services

561
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,950
ask yourself as an institution what is the
reputational cost of Iraq Crucible outputs

562
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:07,131
What's the time and
money cost of verifying repairs.

563
00:45:07,131 --> 00:45:10,591
But done right I can tell
you it's actually not a lot

564
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:13,904
there's actually some benefit to doing
it and ultimately what is the cost and

565
00:45:13,904 --> 00:45:17,974
benefit of transparency if you're
publishing data if you're advocating for

566
00:45:17,974 --> 00:45:24,837
things if you're a policy group
etc These are the mechanisms

567
00:45:24,837 --> 00:45:29,807
exist already at universities so
these are 2 university based.

568
00:45:31,017 --> 00:45:36,137
Verification services that essentially
provided as a service to the faculty

569
00:45:36,137 --> 00:45:40,987
prior to submission does everybody
do that does every paper that

570
00:45:40,987 --> 00:45:45,367
goes out from these universities
use these methods of course not and

571
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:49,347
how to scale this remains an open
issue when I mentioned earlier that.

572
00:45:50,677 --> 00:45:56,197
We do this at the the a it doesn't come
for free and so one of the key concerns is

573
00:45:56,197 --> 00:46:00,887
how can you scale this to other journals
to the general at mechanisms of doing so

574
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:07,289
preemptively checking code archives
conflicts with that restricted access

575
00:46:07,289 --> 00:46:11,549
data so that tension between Access
reproducibility will remain and

576
00:46:11,549 --> 00:46:14,739
in particular if one thinks of

577
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:19,179
tiered access in the federal system in the
United States that will become an issue

578
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:26,881
there are pilots undoing so
which was one of the certification

579
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:30,821
mechanisms that verification reckons that
we're using for public use it also works

580
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:34,961
with the French r.t.c. system and
offers of free service within the r.t.c.

581
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:38,921
to check code and reproducibility
within the secure confines and

582
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:43,822
with all the permissions and place and
finally your students your colleagues

583
00:46:43,822 --> 00:46:48,925
are possible verifiers your
co-authors are possible verified and

584
00:46:48,925 --> 00:46:52,955
the journals we have a job to do as well
any of the standards that I'm putting

585
00:46:52,955 --> 00:46:56,905
forward your methods or tools they need
to be transportable across journals that

586
00:46:56,905 --> 00:47:02,205
cannot be custom solutions so figuring
out what the common standard is and

587
00:47:02,205 --> 00:47:07,370
believe me many of the things
that we see are not homogeneous.

588
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:12,040
So we've put together what my colleagues
it's called the Social Science guild.

589
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:17,060
Collects many of the sky ins
into one place it's expanding.

590
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:21,770
And we want to put this information
on the websites as well so

591
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:26,230
that this doesn't just get stuck
in some reach me on an archive but

592
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:30,720
also possibly become obvious right
on the landing page of a journal

593
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,750
by highlighting the aspects that relate
to how this data could be accessed.

594
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,420
These slides are at this particular DUI
You can also find it on the labor dynamics

595
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:48,140
get up and that's where you'll find
these additional resources as well and.
